               </a>
               <p>In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of 
                  sunlight however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from 
                  Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around on its own axis
                  in exactly the same time it takes to orbit the Earth, meaning 
                  the same side is always facing the Earth. The side facing away
                  from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.

               </a>
               <p>There are two bulges in the Earth due to the gravitational 
                  pull that the Moon exerts; one on the side facing the Moon, and 
                  the other on the opposite side that faces away from the Moon. 
                  The bulges move around the oceans as the Earth rotates, causing 
                  high and low tides around the globe.

               <p>The Moon is moving approximately 3.8 cm away from our planet 
                  every year. It is estimated that it will continue to do so for 
                  around 50 billion years. By the time that happens, the Moon will 
                  be taking around 47 days to orbit the Earth instead of the current
                  27.3 days.

               </a>
               <p>The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its 
                  smaller mass, so you would weigh about one sixth (16.5%) of 
                  your weight on Earth. This is why the lunar astronauts could 
                  leap and bound so high in the air.

               <p>The first man to set foot on the Moon in 1969 was Neil Armstrong 
                  on the Apollo 11 mission, while the last man to walk on the Moon in 
                  1972 was Gene Cernan on the Apollo 17 mission. Since then the Moon 
                  has only be visited by unmanned vehicles.

               <p>This means that the surface of the Moon is unprotected from cosmic 
                  rays, meteorites and solar winds, and has huge temperature variations.
                  The lack of atmosphere means no sound can be heard on the Moon, and 
                  the sky always appears black.

               <p>These are caused by the gravitational pull of the Earth. Lunar 
                  astronauts used seismographs on their visits to the Moon, and found 
                  that small moonquakes occurred several kilometres beneath the surface, 
                  causing ruptures and cracks. Scientists think the Moon has a molten 
                  core, just like Earth.
